Unity Modulate!

This is a small personal architecture project that solves many of problems I've encountered as a solo or game dev or while working with small teams.

Even for a small project, architecture is a key part and having a solid and well defined structure that is designed to reinforce good practices and organization is key for preventing bugs and ensuring your own sanity at times.
If you want to put a good small project or prototype quiclkly, it's a good idea to have this taken care and working for you and releasing you for creativity instead!

This package relies heavily on code generation and a resourceful set of tools that can make your small project to start in no time.
With Modulate! you can have a project architecture setup in seconds.

And what's even better, a modular philosophy ensures your code won't turn into spaghetti, while a Event Bus gives you freedom, flexibiliy and avoids strong references. On top of that, a feature toggle enables you to turn features on or off with a single click.
Let's take a look how it works!
